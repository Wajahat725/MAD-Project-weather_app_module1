       City-based weather search functionality

       Display of temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure

       Animated transitions and responsive design

       Professional user interface with gradient backgrounds

       Technical Implementation:

       State management for dynamic data updates

       Custom animations and smooth interactions
